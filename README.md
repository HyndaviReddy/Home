<p>My Repo Link: 
The name of my app is Home
My app is all about that I have added a new view in my Home Controller which is named as Welcome()
Then I added a new controller called as House Controller
In House Controller I took  3 new methods and named as Apartment(), Independent() and Villa()
and replied with Json, text and Html formats</p>
