My Repo Link: 
The name of my app is Home
Firstly I have added a new view in my Home Controller which is named as Welcome()
Then I added a new controller called as House Controller
In House Controller I took  3 new methods and named as Apartment(), Independent() and Villa()
and replied with Json, text and Html formats.
For Testing I took simple funcion of Tax_Calculation() which calculates the actual value by substracting total_income and deductions.
I included a fact Income_Tax_Calculation_Single() and theory I checked whether the number is even or not.
